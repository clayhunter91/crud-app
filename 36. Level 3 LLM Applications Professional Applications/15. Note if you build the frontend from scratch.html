<html><head></head><body><p><strong>Isabel Gonz√°lez, on the verge of earning the Honor Student distinction, contributes the following regarding the Level 3 Basic App: </strong><br><br>For those who directly deploy the provided code, there will be no issue. <br><br>It only occurs for those who generate their frontend from scratch. It appears that version 13 of Next.js introduces a new file structure when generating the app folder. The lesson recommends creating an index.js in the /pages/ directory, but after the change introduced by Next.js 13, having both pages/index.js and app/page.tsx at the same time causes a conflict because both files represent entry points for the same route (the base route or "/"). <br><br>To adapt to the current /app structure, I had to modify page.tsx to include "use-client" at the beginning to avoid conflict with todo-list.js; the same goes for todo-list.js. <br><br>In summary, after the change in Next.js, if you generate the frontend from scratch, you have two options:</p><p><br>If you prefer to use the new app structure:</p><p>- Delete the pages/index.js file.</p><p>- Move any logic or component you need to keep from pages/index.js to app/page.tsx or create new files within the app folder to handle your routes.</p><p><br></p><p>If you prefer to continue using the traditional pages structure:</p><p>- Delete the app/page.tsx file.</p><p>- Ensure that all the components or pages you need are properly organized within the pages folder.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Well done Isabel! You are one step away from obtaining the Honor Student distinction. Thank you for helping all the students with your contribution and for applying the AI Engineers' philosophy: "when I encounter a problem, I research and experiment until I solve it."</strong></p></body></html>
