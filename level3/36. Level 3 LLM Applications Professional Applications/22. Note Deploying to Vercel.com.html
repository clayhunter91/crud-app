<html><head></head><body><p>In April 2024, <strong>Isabel GonzÃ¡lez</strong> makes this interesting contribution:</p><p><br></p><p>When deploying on Vercel, the command "npm run build" gave me an error: Command "npm run build" exited with 1.<br><br>I couldn't understand why, since I had the environment variables and files configured correctly. So, I thought to reproduce the error in the terminal using the same command, and there it indicated Module not found: Can't resolve '@/styles/globals.css'</p><p><br>I researched the issue and found out it was because there is a file named _app.js inside "pages" that contains an import with an alias '@' on the first line.</p><p><br>Then I corrected it by adapting the next.js to be able to use aliases when referencing directories. If you modify next.js with this change, it can be deployed without problems. Here are the changes introduced in the file 1014-todo-app-fastapi-vercel-fullstack/002-nextjs-frontend/todo-app/<strong>next.config.js</strong>:</p><p><br></p><p>// Import the 'path' module to resolve paths</p><p>const path = require('path');</p><p><br></p><p>const nextConfig = {</p><p>&nbsp; reactStrictMode: true,</p><p><br></p><p>&nbsp; // Extend the Webpack configuration</p><p>&nbsp; webpack: (config) =&gt; {</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; // Set up an alias '@' that points to the root directory of the project</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; config.resolve.alias['@'] = path.resolve(__dirname);</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; return config;</p><p>&nbsp; },</p><p>}</p><p><br></p><p>module.exports = nextConfig;</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Thank you very much for your contribution, Isabel! </strong>Bravo, that's the way an AI Engineer works: when you find a problem, you research, experiment, and solve it. You are VERY close to achieving the Honor Student distinction! ðŸ’ª</p></body></html>
